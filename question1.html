                <div class="bodytext">
                 A 45 year old healthy woman fell while taking a ski lesson on a beginners’ hill at the Mont Tremblant ski resort in Quebec. She was accompanied by an experienced ski instructor who immediately called the ski patrol. She did not show any visible sign of injury but the ski patrol followed strict procedures and brought her back to the bottom of the slope and insisted she should see a doctor. She appeared fine, joked about the fall and a slight headache, but declined seeing a doctor.
            </div>
				
				 <div class="bodytext">
                 An ambulance arrived at 1 p.m. and transported the patient from the foot of the mountain to the infirmary by sleigh.  The patient thought she was fine and didn't want to stay at the infirmary. At 1:10 p.m., the patient signed hospital waiver paperwork and walked 300 yards to her hotel along with her ski instructor. She was back in her room by 1:30 p.m. The ski instructor stayed with her at her hotel. Approximately an hour after the incident the patient was nauseated, feeling light headed, and confused. At 2:59 p.m., paramedics received a second call for help. 
            </div>

                 An ambulance showed up at the hotel exactly ten minutes later. The patient was conscious but had an enlarged left pupil. She was taken to the Centre Hospitalier Laurentien in Ste-Agathe, and later transferred to Hôpital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal before being flown to New York City's Lenox Hill Hospital 12 hours later, where she died.

<div class="bodytext"> The typical pattern of symptoms that indicate an EDH is a loss of consciousness, followed by alertness, then loss of consciousness again. But this pattern may NOT appear in all people. The most important symptoms of an EDH are confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, enlarged pupil in one eye, severe headache, nausea or vomiting and weakness on the opposite side of the enlarged pupil. The symptoms usually occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and indicate an emergency situation. Sometimes, bleeding does not start for hours after a head injury. The symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may not occur right away. Emergency craniotomy is almost always necessary to reduce intracranial pressure. An epidural hematoma has a high risk of death without prompt surgical intervention. Even with prompt medical attention, a significant risk of death and disability remains. </div>
